    //land face up or face down. If a player guesses correctly, then the player is awarded
    //a point. If a player guesses incorrectly, then that player will lose a point.

    //The first player to score five points is the winner.
    //Write a program that simulates the game being played by two players. Use the Coin class
    //that you wrote as an assignment in Chapter 6 (Programming Challenge 17) to simulate
    //the coin. Write a Player to simulate the players.
